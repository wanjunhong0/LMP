The first team to win four games in the seven-game championship round is declared the champion and is awarded the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy. The NBA Finals has been played at the end of every NBA and Basketball Association of America season in history, the first being held in 1947.\n",
      "Between 1985 and 2013, the winner of the NBA Finals was determined through a 2–3–2 format: the first and last two games of the series being played at the arena of the team who earned home court advantage by having the better record during the regular season. Most NBA Finals series were played under the 2–2–1–1–1 format prior to 1985; the Finals returned to this format in 2014. The series was named the BAA Finals from 1947 to 1949 and then changed to the NBA World Championship Series from 1950 to 1982. The following two years, the league used Showdown '83 and Showdown '84. It returned to NBA World Championship Series in 1985, before settling on NBA Finals in 1986.\n",

      "To answer this, we need to find the team that won the NBA Finals with a 4-3 outcome in the shortest time since its foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the facts, we know that the teams that won the NBA Finals with a 4-3 outcome are:\n",
      "\n",

      "* Golden State Warriors - founded in 1946\n",
      "* Detroit Pistons - founded in 1941\n",

      "Among these teams, the Detroit Pistons were founded in 1941, which is the earliest foundation year. However, they did not win the NBA Finals with a 4-3 outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next earliest foundation year is 1946, which is shared by Boston Celtics, Atlanta Hawks, Philadelphia 76ers, and New York Knicks. Among these teams, the Boston Celtics won the NBA Finals with a 4-3 outcome in 1957, 1960, 1962, and 1966.\n",

      "Therefore, the Boston Celtics won the NBA Finals 4-3 in the shortest time since its foundation, which is approximately 11 years (1946-1957).\n"

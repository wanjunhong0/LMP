Insulin resistance can formulate as a result of nutrition disorders, such as consuming high amounts of sugar and refined carbohydrates, leading to an increase in insulin production and subsequent resistance to its effects on cells.\n2. Insulin resistance can formulate as a result of genetic predisposition, where individuals may have a genetic tendency to develop insulin resistance, making them more susceptible to conditions such as Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.\n3. Insulin resistance can formulate as a result of lifestyle factors, such as physical inactivity, obesity, and smoking, which can contribute to the development of insulin resistance and high blood sugar levels.\n4. Insulin resistance can formulate as a result of other medical conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), Cushing's syndrome, and hypothyroidism, which can also contribute to insulin resistance and high blood sugar levels.\n5. Insulin resistance can formulate as a result of certain medications, such as steroids and antipsychotics, which can cause insulin resistance and high blood sugar levels as a side effect.\n\nTherefore, insulin resistance can formulate through a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and medical factors, leading to high blood sugar levels and an increased risk of developing conditions such as Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.", "paths": {"Insulin resistance": {"medicine.disease_cause.diseases": "Insulin resistance is related to diseases such as Acanthosis nigricans, Prediabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and Metabolic syndrome.", "base.schemastaging.context_name.pronunciation": "Insulin resistance is pronounced as \"\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30ea\u30f3\u3066\u3044\u3053\u3046\u305b\u3044\" in Japanese.", "medicine.disease.parent_disease": "Insulin resistance is a type of endocrine disease that can result from nutrition disorders."}}}

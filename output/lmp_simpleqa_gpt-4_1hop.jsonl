Eliot notes that human beliefs grow beyond systematic barriers. She expresses a desire to maintain ties with the past. Eliot observes that many middle-aged men lose their aspirations to shape their own lives. She comments on the commonality among men, regardless of their gentleness or simplicity. Eliot dismisses the significance of hypothetical possibilities in understanding behavior. She acknowledges the impact of unhistorical acts on the world's goodness. Eliot describes a subtle form of jealousy that stems from egoism. She suggests that having little feeling can protect against overwhelming emotions. Eliot believes duties arise from present circumstances rather than past possibilities. She questions the purpose of life if not to alleviate each other's difficulties. Eliot reflects on the unity of humanity in the face of calamity."}}}

If pot is legalized, it won't be for the benefit of individuals but for the authorities. The pharma industry is about making billions from milligrams. The basic question is why people take drugs; is there something wrong with society that pressures individuals to guard against it? The worst drugs are as bad as reported; people use them for personal, social, and emotional reasons. Alcohol and tobacco are recognizable poisons, and their consumption can lead to the destruction of civilization. Drug frenzy can escalate quickly in a nation, leading to extreme measures like urine tests for employment. Tobacco and opium can bear the burdens of armies, providing joy and harm.

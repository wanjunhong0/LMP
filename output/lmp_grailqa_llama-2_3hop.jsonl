It is better to be unborn than to be ill-bred. A wolf resembles a dog, and a flatterer resembles a friend. Whoever commands the sea commands the trade, and consequently the riches of the world and the world itself. Hatreds are the cinders of affection. He who does not do as other men do, but endeavors to do what ought to be done, shall thereby rather incur peril than preservation. Historians should set down the simple truth and not say anything for love or hatred. It is the nature of men to run headlong into the other extreme, forgetting that virtue doth always consist in the mean. No man is esteemed for colorful garments except by fools and women. No one is wise or safe but they that are honest. Death is eloquent, just, and mighty, and has persuaded and cast out of the world all the far-stretched greatness, all the pride, cruelty, and ambition of man. Remember that if you marry for beauty, thou bindest thyself all thy life for that which perchance will neither last nor please thee one year. Talking much is a sign of vanity, for the one who is lavish with words is cheap in deeds. The world is but a large prison, out of which some are daily selected for execution. There is nothing exempt from the peril of mutation; the earth, heavens, and whole world is thereunto subject. Use your youth so that you may have comfort to remember it when it has forsaken you, and not sigh and grieve at the account thereof. War begets quiet, quiet idleness, idleness disorder, disorder ruin; likewise ruin order, order virtue, virtue glory, and good fortune.

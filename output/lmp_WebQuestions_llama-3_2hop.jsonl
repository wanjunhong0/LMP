Another theory is that during the Norman Conquest of England in the 11th century, French was the language of the ruling class, and English speakers may have used French phrases, including curse words, to sound more elegant or sophisticated, and later apologized for doing so.\n\nNote: There is no definitive answer to the origin of the phrase, and these are just possible explanations based on historical context and linguistic evolution.", "paths": {"French": {}}}

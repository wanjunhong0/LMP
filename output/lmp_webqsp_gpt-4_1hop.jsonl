My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what, together, we can do for the freedom of man.; But peace does not rest in the charters and covenants alone. It lies in the hearts and minds of all people. So let us not rest all our hopes on parchment and on paper, let us strive to build peace, a desire for peace, a willingness to work for peace in the hearts and minds of all of our people. I believe that we can. I believe the problems of human destiny are not beyond the reach of human beings.; Failure has no friends.; For without belittling the courage with which men have died, we should not forget those acts of courage with which men have lived.; Forgive your enemies, but never forget their names.; I am deeply touchednot as deeply touched as you have been coming to this dinner, but nevertheless it is a sentimental occasion.; I ask that you offer to the political arena, and to the critical problems of our society which are decided therein, the benefit of the talents which society has helped to develop in you. I ask you to decide, as Goethe put it, whether you will be an anvilor a hammer. The question is whether you are to be a hammerwhether you are to give to the world in which you were reared and educated the broadest possible benefits of that education.; I look forward to an America which will not be afraid of grace and beauty.; If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.; Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans.; Of course, both major parties today seek to serve the national interest. They would do so in order to obtain the broadest base of support, if for no nobler reason. But when party and officeholder differ as to how the national interest is to be served, we must place first the responsibility we owe not to our party or even to our constituents but to our individual consciences.; Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education. The human mind is our fundamental resource.; Sometimes party loyalty asks too much.; The day before my inauguration President Eisenhower told me, You'll find that no easy problems ever come to the President of the United States. If they are easy to solve, somebody else has solved them. I found that hard to believe, but now I know it is true.; The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring this endeavor will light our bounty and all who serve it, and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.; The farmer is the only man in our economy who buys everything at retail, sells everything at wholesale, and pays the freight both ways.; There is always inequity in life. Some men are killed in a war and some men are wounded, and some men never leave the country, and some men are stationed in the Antarctic and some are stationed in San Francisco. Its very hard in military or in personal life to assure complete equality. Life is unfair.; We are under exercised as a nation. We look instead of play. We ride instead of walk. Our existence deprives us of the minimum of physical activity essential for healthy living.; We must use time as a tool, not as a couch.; When written in Chinese, the word crisis is composed of two characters -- one represents danger, and the other represents opportunity.", "base.inaugurations.inauguration_speaker.inauguration": "The John F.
